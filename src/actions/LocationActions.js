  //**   Data Dependencies
  //   Dealing with data dependencies between stores is often a tricky and time consuming endeavour. This is one of the reasons why flux was originally built. Flux comes with this method called waitFor which signals to the dispatcher that this store depends on another store for its data.
  // Say we have a new FavoritesStore where youâ€™ll be able to mark your favorite locations. We want to update the LocationStore only after the FavoriteStore gets its update.
  favoriteLocation(locationId) {
    this.dispatch(locationId);
  }
